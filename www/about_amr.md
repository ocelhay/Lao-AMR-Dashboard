## Antimicrobial Resistance

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the major challenges to human health. Antimicrobial resistant organisms are not inhibited or killed by standard treatments, which can result in poorer health outcomes. AMR encompasses resistance in bacterial (e.g. E. coli) , protozoal (e.g. malaria), viral (e.g. influenza), and fungal pathogens.

The recent [Oâ€™Neill report](https://amr-review.org) estimated that, by 2050, 10 million people will die every year due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) unless a global response to the problem of AMR is mounted. More information on AMR can be found by following these links:

- [US Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html)

This web application focusses on AMR in bacteria, i.e. antibiotic resistance. The purpose of the application is to allow clinicians and laboratory workers to upload laboratory data and generate flexible summary tables and plots based on the reporting requirements of the [World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (WHO GLASS)](http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/surveillance/glass/en/).
